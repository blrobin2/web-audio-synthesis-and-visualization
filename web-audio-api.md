# Web Audio API

You are at a switchboard, where you can connect different audio sources to different audio destinations.

With Web Audio, we have nodes. For example, a microphone is an AudioNode. A speaker is an AudioDestinationNode.

You can also use an audio file such as an mp3 as an AudioNode.

You can also introduce effects on the audio stream such as a filter or a delay. You can also split the audio stream into multiple audio streams and perform operations on each audio stream, such as output on one and analysis on another.

You can mix multiple audio streams together into a single node.
