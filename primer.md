# How Audio Works

## Sound

Is really just waves. A wave of vibration in air molecules.

## Waveform

A sine wave is the simplest waveform. Music tracks have much more complex waveforms.

The vertical axis is amplitude. The horizontal axis is time. When a line is flat, it means the amplitude is constant. When a line is up and down, it means the amplitude is changing over time.

## Frequency

Can be high or low. High frequency means more vibrations per second. Low frequency means fewer vibrations per second. High frequency is a high pitch sound. Low frequency is a low pitch sound.
